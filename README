bfuc v0.0.2
===========

x86_64 Brainfuck compiler written in x84_64 assembly.

Reads input from stdin or a file path passed as the first argument.
Outputs an ELF executable with the name "a.out".

bfuc is written entirely (not counting cpp macros) in GAS syntax 
x86_64 assembly, using only POSIX syscalls and zero external libraries.
As a result, it and its output programs will work only on x84_64 *nix systems,
although bear in mind that I only bothered to test it on Linux.

This software is utterly pointless and exists only as a statement of
the author's abundance of free time.
