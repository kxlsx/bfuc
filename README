bfuc v0.0.4
===========

ABOUT
-----
bfuc is written entirely (not counting cpp macros) in GAS syntax 
x86_64 assembly, using only POSIX syscalls and zero external libraries.
As a result, it and its output programs will work only on x84_64 *nix systems,
although bear in mind that I only bothered to test it on Linux.

This compiler is neither good nor fun to use; it is utterly pointless and 
exists only as a statement of the author's abundance of free time.

COMPILATION QUIRKS
------------------
 * Reads input from stdin or a file path passed as the first argument.
 * Outputs an ELF executable with the name "a.out".
 * On error, returns a negative error value and prints a message to stderr.

COMPILED QUIRKS
---------------
 * Cells are byte-sized.
 * On termination, the program returns the value of the current cell.
 * On EOF the cell's value remains unchanged.
 * Reading & writing is unbuffered, maybe I'll fix it sometime.
